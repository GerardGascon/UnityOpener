# Unity Opener

A CLI program that takes a directory of a Unity project as an argument and tries to open it with the proper editor version.

## Proper usage

1. Build the project and move the .exe file into a folder
2. Add that folder to the PATH

By doing that you should be able to open the project using the terminal.

```bash
C:\Project Path> unity .
```
